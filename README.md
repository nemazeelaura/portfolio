## Approach

For my last project I was going to make a website for a friend. This did not meet the project criteria so decided to add a before and after page the the portfolio website that I just started wotking on. My goal was to add some cool animations and have the before and after pictures slide in from the left and right hand sides of the page and then have some other cool animation effect as well. I used flexbox because I am very interested in learning how to use it. I have a simple contact form at http://www.lauranemazee.com/contact_form/ a user can enter info and submit and the form fields will be emailed to me and also inserted into MySQL DB. I have another form at http://www.lauranemazee.com/admin/ that is meant for Admin use. I can edit or delete entries that users have submitted.

The 'admin' directory is password protected by Apache .htaccess file that I created from the Dreamhost admin panel. The form has full DRUD functionality: create, Read, Update and Delete that is done with PHPfunctions.


*Hurdles and Unsolved Problems*
I have everything set up for mobile working now. My goal is to have it looking good on desktop by project presentation time. 

- It took a lot of time to figure out how the code samples worked that I found online and more time to customize them to my specific needs

- I had some problems with images not behaving as expected and the alignment of flexboxes.
