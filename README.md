## Approach

For my last project, I was going to make a website for a friend. This did not meet the project criteria so decided to add a before and after page to the portfolio website that I just started working on. My goal was to add some cool animations and have the before and after pictures slide in from the left and right-hand sides of the page and then have some other cool animation effect as well. I used flexbox because I am very interested in learning how to use it. I have a simple contact form at http://www.lauranemazee.com/contact_form/ made with bootstrap from a web3 schools sample. A user can enter info and submit. The form fields will be emailed to me and also inserted into MySQL DB. I have another form at http://www.lauranemazee.com/admin/ that is meant for Admin use. I can edit or delete entries that users have submitted to my database.

The 'admin' directory is password protected by Apache .htaccess file that I created from the Dreamhost admin panel. The form has full CRUD functionality: Create, Read, Update and Delete that is done with PHP functions.


*Hurdles and Unsolved Problems:*
I have everything set up for mobile working now. My goal is to have it looking good on desktop by project presentation time.

- It took a lot of time to figure out how the code samples worked that I found online and more time to customize them to my specific needs.

- I had some problems with images not behaving as expected and the alignment of flexboxes.
